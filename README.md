# HIPpocampal Shape and Thickness Analysis - HIPSTA


## Purpose:

This repository contains a collection of scripts for hippocampal shape and thickness 
analysis as described in our recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120182).

## Description:

The main analysis script performs the following major processing steps:

0. preprocess image (cropping, upsampling, automask)
1. create labels
   1. extract HSF labels from label image
   2. merge individual labels
2. attach molecular layer to neighboring regions (if present)
3. create mask
   1. fill holes using dilation and erosion
   2. create final mask
4. create surface
   1. create initial surface using marching cube algorithm
   2. topology fixing (optional)
   3. smooth (fixed) surface
   4. remesh surface (optional)
5. create tetrahedral mesh from triangular surface
6. create label files for tetra mesh
7. remove boundary mask (preprocessing for mesh cutting)
8. cut open tetrahedral mesh at anterior and posterior ends
9. create cube parametrization
10. compute thickness and curvature
11. map subfield values (and other volume-based data)
12. create supplementary files for visualization


## Current status and future development:

The hippocampal shape and thickness analysis package is currently in its beta stage, which means 
that it's open for testing, but may still contain unresolved issues. Future changes with regard 
to the algorithms, interfaces, and package structure are to be expected.

In the near future, we anticipate the following changes and additions:

- improved documentation including walk-through examples
- improved interfaces and installation options; availability as a python package
- provision of Docker and/or Singularity files to avoid issues with differences in dependencies and enviroments

## Example:

The most straigthforward way of running the shape and thickness analysis is from 
the command line:

`python3 shapetools.py --filename /my/segmentation/file --hemi lh --lut fs711  --outputdir /my/output/directory`

However, this requires that some additional settings are made and that some external 
software packages are installed. See the sections on [installation](#installation) 
and [requirements](#requirements).

As an alternative to directly running the scripts, we also provide [Docker](docker/Docker.md) 
and [Singularity](singularity/Singularity.md) versions of the package, which 
facilitate processing across different environments and take care of installing 
additional dependencies.


## Outputs:

1. The primary output are thickness values that will be computed and stored as
   CSV or PSOL or MGH overlay files within the 'thickness' folder. The PSOL or
   MGH files can be overlaid onto the mid-surface vtk file that is also found
   within the 'thickness' folder.

2. Intermediate volume and surface files, each prefixed with the particular
   operation performed. The basic pattern for the filenames is:

   `<hemisphere>.<prefixes>.<hsf-labels>.<suffixes>`

## Supported segmentations:

- If using the `ashs` segmentation, additional labels for the hippocampal head
  (label value: 20) and tail (label value: 5) labels are recommended.
- Topological fixing (`--topological-fixing <filename1> <filename2>`) should
  not be used unless working with FreeSurfer-processed data. `<filename1>` is
  the `brain.mgz` file and `<filename2>` is the `wm.mgz` file, both found within
  the `mri` subdirectory of an individual FreeSurfer output directory.
- If using a custom look-up table (`--lut <filename>`), the expected format for
  the file is: `<numeric ID> <name> <R> <G> <B> <A>`. \<R\>, \<G\>, \<B\>, \<A\> are
  numerical values for RGB colors and transparency (alpha) and will be ignored.
  For example, `236 Subiculum 255 0 0 0`. Each line may only contain a single
  anatomical structure. Do not use a header line. The following labels need to
  be present in the look-up table: _presubiculum_, _subiculum_, _ca1_, _ca2_,
  _ca3_, _ca4_, _head_, and _tail_. Additional labels may be present, but will
  be ignored. Lines starting with `#` will be ignored (and can be used for
  comments).
- Multiple substructures can have the same numeric ID, e.g. _presubiculum_ and
  _subiculum_ can have the same numeric ID if these substructures are not
  distinguished in the segmentation. The _head_ and _tail_ subregions can have 
  multiple labels if these are distinguished in the segmentation, but should be 
  combined for the processing within the hippocampal shapetools.


## Installation:

Use the following code to download this package from its GitHub repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Deep-MI/Hipsta.git`

You can use the following code to install the required Python depencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

It is recommended to run this pipeline within its own virtual environment.

The above steps are not necessary when running the [Docker](docker/Docker.md) or
[Singularity](singularity/Singularity.md) versions of the package.

## Requirements:

Unless using the [Docker](docker/Docker.md) or [Singularity](singularity/Singularity.md) 
versions of the package, the following conditions need to be met for running an
analysis:

1. A FreeSurfer version (6.x or 7.x) must be sourced, i.e. FREESURFER_HOME must
exist as an environment variable and point to a valid FreeSurfer installation.

2. A hippocampal subfield segmentation created by FreeSurfer 7.11 or later
or the ASHS software. A custom segmentation is also permissible (some restrictions
and settings apply; see [Supported Segmentations](https://github.com/Deep-MI/Hipsta#supported-segmentations)).

3. Python 3.8 or higher including the lapy, numpy, scipy, nibabel, pyvista, and
pyacvd libraries, among others. See `requirements.txt` for a full list, and use
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install.

4. The gmsh package (verson 2.x; http://gmsh.info) must be installed. Can be
downloaded e.g. as binaries for [linux](https://gmsh.info/bin/Linux/gmsh-2.16.0-Linux64.tgz) or
[MacOSX](https://gmsh.info/bin/MacOSX/gmsh-2.16.0-MacOSX.dmg) . The 'gmsh' binary must 
be on the $PATH:

    `export PATH=${PATH}:/path/to/gmsh-directory/bin`

5. The PYTHONPATH environment variable should include the toolbox directory:

    `export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/hipsta-package`
